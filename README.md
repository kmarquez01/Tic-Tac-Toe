# Tic-Tac-Toe
 
Tic Tac Toe is essentially a game where an individual is required to obtain a win, by having their corresponding shape (eg. "x" or "o") align in a consecutive order. This can be done diagonally, vertically, or horizontally.

The objective is either to win, or obtain a draw by blocking the path of the opponent.

This is a [PYTHON] two player tic tac toe project inspired by the minigame from Google and Codetech. When a winning row is determined, a prompt to restart is given and the phrase "game over" appears indicating it's end.

You can run the game by opening [tictactoe.exe].
